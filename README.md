**~ I SWEATED YESTERDAY ~**

This is a small application to count the days that I did any kind of exercise (sport) to be used in the office that I work.

Why **Yesterday**? `Because we always mark the exercise one day after when we arrive to the office.`



***Visit** [i-sweated-yesterday app](https://maxcnunes.pythonanywhere.com/ "Click here to visit the demo application")* hosted on *pythonanywhere.com* to see the demo application running and ***Download** [version 1.0 here](https://github.com/maxcnunes/i-sweated-yesterday/archive/v1.0.zip)* explained in [this post](http://blog.maxcnunes.net/2012/12/24/desenvolvendo-pequena-aplicacao-web-python-flask/) on  my blog.
